## User Stories
1. As a maintanence staff and park management staff, I want to register and log in to the system to be able to access data.
   
- AC #1: As a new user, I can register using my employee ID.
  
- AC #2: As a registered user, I can log in to access data.
     
2. As a park administrator, I want to automate the park's lighting system to optimize energy consumption based on daylight conditions.

- AC #1: The system changes how bright the park lights are or turns them on/off by itself using readings from special sensors that measure the current light around.
  
- AC #2: The system gathers and saves past information about light levels, energy use, and how the system works. This info helps park management staff study how the system is used, find ways to make it better, and set up lighting schedules for more efficiency

3. As a park management staff, I want to monitor crowd situations so that I can identify popular spots.
   
- AC #1: I want to monitor crowd density in real-time.
  
- AC #2: I want to identify popular areas within the park during specific times. Use this information to suggest optimal locations and timings for events and activities.

4. As a park visitor, I want the lights to turn on automatically when I walk pass at night.

- AC #1: At night, light turns on automatically when I walk pass.
   
- AC #2: At morning, light don't turn on when I walk pass.
