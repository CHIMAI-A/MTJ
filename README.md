## Stakeholder
1. Park staff

## User Stories

1. As a park staff, I want to automate the park's lighting system to optimize energy consumption based on daylight conditions.

- AC #1: I want the system to autonomously adjust the brightness of park lights or control their on/off status based on readings from specialized sensors that measure the current ambient light conditions.

- AC #2: I want the system to accumulate and store historical data regarding light levels, energy usage, and operational functionality.

- AC #3: I want to utilize this information for park management to study system usage, identify improvement opportunities, and establish more efficient lighting schedules.

- AC #4: I want to be notified the moment an issue arises in the lighting system, minimizing downtime and ensuring fast resolution.

2. As a park staff, I want to monitor crowd situations so that I can identify popular spots.
