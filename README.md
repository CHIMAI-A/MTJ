## Stakeholder

## User Stories
1. As a park staff, I want to automate the park's lighting system to optimize energy consumption based on daylight conditions.

- AC #1: I want the system to autonomously adjust the brightness of park lights or control their on/off status based on readings from specialized sensors that measure the     current ambient light conditions.
  
- AC #2: I want the system to accumulate and store historical data regarding light levels, energy usage, and operational functionality.

- AC #3: I want to utilize this information for park management to study system usage, identify improvement opportunities, and establish more efficient lighting schedules.

2. As a park staff, I want to monitor crowd situations so that I can identify popular spots.
   
- AC #1: I want to monitor crowd density in real-time.
  
- AC #2: I want to identify popular areas within the park during specific times. Use this information to suggest optimal locations and timings for events and activities.
